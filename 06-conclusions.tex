\section{Further work}\label{sec:furtherwork}
There is much further work that can be applied to this project.

First and foremost would be to implement further optimisations, such as the
inter-block algorithm by Bailey and the refinements done by Shannon show great
potential for further improvements especially with the tight loops of the
programs tested in this project.

Other options would be to more properly prove that the implementation of the
emulators, and the conversion routines is correct. Formal methods to
mathematically prove correctness could even be used if so inclined. This could
be taken further to automatically generate test programs that try to break the
conversion or the emulators, generally referred to as ``fuzz testing''
