== intro ==

good afternoon

transmeta paper

project focuses on something related to this, but using stack machine as a base processor instead of the RISC-type processor

== literature ==

register machines
- risc vs cisc
  - z80
  - x86

stack machines

stack optimisations
- peephole
- stack-scheduling
- bailey
- shannon

binary translation
- ibm
- transputer
- more transmeta detail
  - include diagram
  - ultimately disappointing performance (cheating, crashing, etc)

== implementation ==
architectural choices
- language
- processor architectures
- just state?

program structure
- diagram

examples of optimisations

cache

== results ==

graphs
- relative instruction count
- relative memory accesses count
- mapping by block
- program cost

== conclusion ==

summary/implications
future
