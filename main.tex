\begin{abstract}
	This project will require a strong affinity for machine level programming \&
	architecture understanding. Programming is more than likely to be undertaken
	in Java or C, depending upon the implementation platform. Competence in all
	of these areas would be a benefit.

	Transmeta are a US based company, who recently surprised the computer
	architecture world by developing a chip which dynamically translates Intel
	binary code into machine language instructions for another (highly optimised
	RISC) CPU core.  In doing so it allows Intel code to execute in real-time
	without recompilation, but using a (claimed) much more power efficient
	processor architecture.

	This project attempts to explore something related to the above experiment,
	however the focus will be on translating code into potentially parallel
	sections using a technique called microthreading. Choosing a relatively
	simple register machine for which complier, assembler, and simulator (or
	processor) are readily available would be a sensible approach. The project
	will involve writing a translator algorithm in high level code, but if time
	allows the translator can be â€“recoded in low-level code, or at least
	optimised to be as streamlined as possible (the speed of translation is a
	critical factor).
