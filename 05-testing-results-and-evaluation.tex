\chapter{Testing, Results and Evaluation}\label{ch:testingresults}

Due to the emulated nature of the implementation of this project, the only
meaningful metric that can be taken from the results would be comparing
instruction counts between the register program and the unoptimised and
optimised stack programs.

Testing will be done using programs based on the Standford Benchmarking Suite,
which was also used by Koopman. This suite comprises of a bubble sort, matrix
multiplication, perm, queens, quicksort, a prime sieve \& a towers of hanoi
implementation.
