\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Aims}
This project aims to show that by converting code written for a simple
register-based architecture or processor to a stack-based architecture,
performance improvements can be found.

\section{Limitations}
Sourcing physical processors and the toolchains capable of running on both the
register-based and stack-based architectures is difficult, as what exists
already tends to be either years out of date, with only partial support, or does
not exist on both platforms. As such, this project will seek to emulate the
architectures instead.

Since the architectures will be emulated, there are precious few advantages to
continuing to use the architecture's native binary code, so this project will
instead take in some form of the respective architecture's assembly language.

\section{Statement of Ethics}
This project does not have any ethical concerns. As Transmeta have already done
a more advanced version of this project nearly two decades ago with their Crusoe
processor, any implications of the results of this project will be unlikely to
affect any commercial businesses. The software produced by this project will be
released open-source once it is completed under a permissive licence, should
anyone else want to take the project further.
